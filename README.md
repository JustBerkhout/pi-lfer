# pi-lfer
A lazy way of "calculating" π

## pu-rpose

`pi-lfer` is a slow running `bash` process that copies `π` digit-by-digit from a source file. I use it to simulate a long running process, in demonstrations of headless cloud-based computing.

## so-urce

The source of digits for `π` in this repository is the file `pi-hundred-thousand.txt` which has been pilfered from `pi-billion.txt` from [stuff.mit.edu](https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/sipb/contrib/pi/)
